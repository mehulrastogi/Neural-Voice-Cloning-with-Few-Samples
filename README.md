# Neural-Voice-Cloning-with-Few-Samples
Implementation of the paper titled "Neural Voice Cloning with Few Samples" by Baidu [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06006)

A checkpoint for the encoder trained on 56k epochs with a loss of 0.0810 can be found in the checkpoints directory

The repository is only partially complete
